# Msc-Project
This code was written for the purpose of analysing 18 Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma tumour samples along with three fetal pituitary tissue controls and three non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) controls.

Part A
This is code for the quality control and transcript abundance quantification.

Part B
This is the first regression model consisting of all eighteen ACP tumour samples and all the six control samples. The controls are the base level for analysis hence Controls vs ACP.

Part C
This is the second regression model consisting of all eighteen ACP tumour samples, the three Fetal pituitary tissue controls and the three non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) controls. The controls are the base level for analysis hence Fetal vs ACP and NFPA vs ACP.

Part D
This is the third regression model consisting of the ACP samples separated into those that had glial tissue and those that lacked the glial tissue, three Fetal pituitary tissue  controls and three non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) controls. The ACP samples are the base levels for analysis hence ACP(Non-glial) vs controls(Fetal and NFPA) and ACP(Glial)vs controls(Fetal and NFPA).
